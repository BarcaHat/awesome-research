# Coupling

**Coupling** is a concept in software engineering that describes the level of dependency between different components or modules in a system.

- **Tightly Coupled**: When two components are tightly coupled, they heavily depend on each other. Changes in one component will likely require changes in the other. Tightly coupled systems can be challenging to maintain and extend because they lack flexibility. However, they may have faster communication between components because of their close relationship.
  
- **Loosely Coupled**: When two components are loosely coupled, they have minimal dependencies on each other. They communicate through well-defined interfaces or APIs, making it easier to modify one component without impacting others. Loose coupling is preferred in modern development as it improves maintainability, testability, and scalability.

In modern web development, loose coupling is emphasized to make components and services interchangeable and independently deployable, enabling easier debugging, testing, and feature addition.
