Angular is a powerful, full-featured front-end framework developed by Google for building dynamic, single-page applications (SPAs). Unlike libraries like React (which focuses mainly on the view layer), Angular provides a complete solution for building robust applications with a wide range of built-in tools for data handling, routing, form validation, testing, and more. It follows a component-based architecture, similar to React, but offers additional features and a stricter framework structure, which can aid in large-scale application development. Here’s an overview of Angular’s key concepts and how it differs from traditional or "normal" development approaches:

### Key Aspects of Angular

1. **Component-Based Architecture**:
   - Angular applications are built from modular, reusable components. Each component encapsulates the HTML, CSS, and logic for a specific part of the user interface, making it easier to manage complex applications and keep the code organized. Traditional development often has separate files for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which can become challenging to organize in large applications.

2. **Two-Way Data Binding**:
   - Angular’s two-way data binding allows synchronization between the model (data) and the view (UI). When the model updates, the view reflects the changes automatically, and when the view changes, it updates the model. This can reduce boilerplate code but can also impact performance in very large applications. Traditional development often requires manually updating the DOM or managing variables to keep data and UI in sync.

3. **Dependency Injection**:
   - Angular provides a built-in dependency injection system, which makes it easier to manage dependencies and create loosely coupled components. It also makes testing easier, as dependencies can be injected rather than hard-coded. Traditional development typically lacks a native dependency injection system, making it harder to manage complex relationships between parts of an application.

4. **Reactive Forms and Validation**:
   - Angular offers a powerful form-handling system, including both template-driven and reactive forms with built-in validation. This structure makes it easier to handle complex forms and validations. Traditional development usually requires creating custom validation and form-handling logic, which can be repetitive and error-prone.

5. **CLI and Modular Structure**:
   - Angular has a Command Line Interface (CLI) that streamlines development by providing commands for generating components, services, modules, and other files, enforcing consistent structure, and reducing setup time. The CLI also helps with testing, building, and deployment. Traditional development typically involves more manual setup, directory structuring, and configuration.

6. **TypeScript**:
   - Angular is built with TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing. TypeScript allows developers to catch errors during development, supports better tooling, and improves code maintainability. Traditional development is generally based on JavaScript, which is dynamically typed and doesn’t provide the compile-time checks TypeScript offers.

7. **Built-In Routing and State Management**:
   - Angular includes a router that makes it easy to handle navigation within an application, including features like lazy loading, which can optimize performance. Additionally, Angular services allow for shared state management between components. Traditional development usually requires manual setup of routing or additional libraries for state management, which can increase complexity.

8. **Directives**:
   - Angular uses directives to add behavior to elements in the DOM. Directives like `ngFor` and `ngIf` are used to manipulate the DOM structure based on conditions or data, making it easy to create dynamic UIs. In traditional development, you’d typically use JavaScript or jQuery to achieve similar effects, but without the built-in structure and consistency Angular provides.

9. **Reactive Programming with RxJS**:
   - Angular embraces reactive programming with RxJS (Reactive Extensions for JavaScript), which is a library for handling asynchronous events and data streams. It provides a powerful way to handle asynchronous data, making it ideal for applications with real-time updates. Traditional development approaches may not use reactive programming by default, often relying on callbacks or promises for handling async operations, which can be less powerful or flexible.

### How Angular Differs from Traditional Development

In traditional development (using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript or jQuery), developers often rely on custom scripts, direct DOM manipulation, and manually handle application logic. Angular, by contrast, provides a cohesive and opinionated structure with built-in solutions for routing, dependency injection, form validation, data handling, and more, making it ideal for larger and more complex applications.

Angular's emphasis on TypeScript, declarative syntax, component-based architecture, and two-way data binding also sets it apart. While traditional approaches might be simpler and faster to start with for small applications, Angular's features and structure make it easier to build, maintain, and scale large applications.
